# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Master Repository**! This repository is dedicated to building a solid foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**, focusing on both **theory + basic implementation** and **problem-solving** through approximately **400+ handpicked problems** that are commonly asked in technical interviews and competitive programming.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic in this repository is divided into two parts:

1. **`TheoryAndBasicImplementation/`** – Detailed notes, basic code templates, and conceptual clarity.
2. **`Problems/`** – A curated set of problems to build strong intuition and problem-solving skills.
