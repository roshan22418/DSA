# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Master Repository**! This repository is dedicated to building a solid foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**, focusing on both **theory + basic implementation** and **problem-solving** through approximately **400+ handpicked problems** that are commonly asked in technical interviews and competitive programming.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic in this repository is divided into two parts:

1. **`TheoryBasicImplementation/`** –basic code templates, and conceptual clarity theory done by later till now only coding.
2. **`Problems/`** – A curated set of problems to build strong intuition and problem-solving skills.

## 🔧 How to Use

- Go to any topic folder (e.g., `Arrays/`).
- Inside you'll find:
  - `TheoryAndBasicImplementation/`: Implementation, patterns, and templates.
  - `Problems/`: A collection of problems with solution.

---

## 🧠 Problem Difficulty Distribution as we do 

- **Easy:** ~150-200 problems – Focused on syntax and logic building.
- **Medium:** ~200 problems – Interview-level with optimization.
- **Hard:** ~50-100 problems – Advanced concepts, multiple patterns.
